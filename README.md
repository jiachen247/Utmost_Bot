# utmost_bot
Telegram bot that servers content from My Utmost for his Highest by Oswald Chambers
hosted on GAE.

Based off LljBot by @whipermr5

#story time
This bot was born out of the love for two things. Utmost of His Highest and Bots

It is my sincere desire that this bot will truly lead people to have a deep and personal daily quiet time.

#on a side note
Added 2 layers of cache to optimize response time by removing network IO
    1. GAE's Memcache
    2. GAE's Datastore

This lead to 2 things,
    a cut of response time by more than half +
    generating alot less traffic for utmost.org

So far, all usage has been under GAE's free qouta YAYERS:)


To God be the Glory
